## Features
### Raycasting Methodology 
The program uses the perpendicular distance to the camera plane to prevent the fish-eye effect caused by using Euclidian distance. Rays are sent out from the player's direction in a 66Â° field of view. The resolution of the number of rays is the same as the number of horizontal pixels on the screen. The program contains a mini-map displaying the rays emanating from the player.

In green, the current player's position is shown; in yellow, the rays sent from the player are shown; in white, walls are represented; and in black, empty space is represented.

### Reading Ancient Books
The main focus of the program is the ability to read ancient books. The top 100 classical antiquity books (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/bookshelf/24) were downloaded from a Project Gutenberg mirror site to allow for bulk downloading. The script used for the download is located in the `/get_books` subfolder. When the player gets within 2 block units of a wall, they are presented with a random book on the right side of the screen.

The program saves the user's current location in the book and subsequent visits to that book will remember the current location. Only one book is loaded at a time to prevent high memory usage.
